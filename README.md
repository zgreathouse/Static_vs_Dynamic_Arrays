# Static vs. Dynamic arrays

## This Project is an effort to develop a deeper understanding of the most commonly utilized structures, arrays. Looking into how arrays are Static in lower level languages such as C, where memory allocation is contiguous. Also looking to how Ruby utilizes arrays under the hood. Ruby has a Dynamic structure to it's arrays. This allows us to manipulate our array structure in all sorts of ways with dozens of different methods like push, pop, and many other methods (including iterators and enumerables).

##In this project I have built out the following Data Structures:

### Static Array
### Ring Buffer
### Dynamic Array
